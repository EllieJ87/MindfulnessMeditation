# Mindfuless Meditation

This is taken inspiration from my Random Quote Machine project that I did for the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Project.  

I had a selection of Mindful Meditation cards and I wanted to make this into a web page, this was to amke it easily accessible for on the go or when I need to take a moment and practice Mindful Meditation.

This has 100 meditation to break you away from everyday stress and bring you back to a sense of calmness and to reflect on every day life and living!

There are some differences between my wireframes and my final website. 

I decided to add a footer so users could interact with me or check out my other works in the social media links. 

## <a name="featuressite">Features</a>

This section is a brief highlight of features that this site contains.

### <a name="maincontainer">Main Container</a>

- This is vertially and horizontally central on the main view width
- This contains the meditation body that generates a new quote when the button is clicked
- Button to generate new quote at random

### <a name="footerfeatures">Footer</a>

- Contains the copyright text, this is on the right side of the page which is then centred and on the bottom of the social media links on smaller screens for easy readability.
- Contains the ‘LinkedIn’ and ‘GitHub’ navigation links on the left side of the page and evenly spaced these are then stacked ontop of the copyright text, these are centred to the width of the screen
- All navigation links have an animation and a colour change when the user hover over the icon, this is so the user knows they are interactive and have a purpose
- The ‘LinkedIn’ and ‘GitHub’ icons opens a new window to the relevant page 
- The footer runs along and is fixed at the bottom with no fill colour to make this easy to read and visual appealing

## <a name="technologies">Technologies Used</a>

[Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html) 

-	I've used Adobe XD to create wireframes of my website before building the actual site.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

-	The project uses the Bootstrap framework to add a responsive grid system, prebuilt components, plugins built on jQuery, and Bootstrap styles to my game, before adding my own custom styling 

[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

-	The project uses CSS to apply the custom styles to create the look of my game.  The index.html file is linked directly to the main.css stylesheet

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/) 

-	The project uses Font Awesome icons for all navigation and social media links that feature in the header and footer of my site

Google Chrome Dev Tools

-	For testing purposes for responsive design

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)

-	Google fonts was used to import ‘Orbiton font and ‘Sarpanch’ into the HTML which is used on all pages throughout the project.

[HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

-	The project uses HTML to create the basic elements and content of my game 

[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

-	The project uses JavaScript from my custom script.js file to add functionality and interactivity to my text adventure game.  This is the core focus of this project.  The project also uses JavaScript from Bootstrap which is required to add functionality to the Bootstrap modal 

[jQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery)

-	The project uses jQuery to simplify DOM manipulation. This is both the standard jQuery that is built with Bootstrap components, and my custom jQuery used in my index.html and script.js files

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

-	I used Visual Studio Code as the development environment to write the code for my website

### <a name="versioncontrol">Version Control</a>

[Git](https://git-scm.com)

-	I've used Git as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in Visual Studio Code, before pushing them to GitHub.

[GitHub](https://github.com)

-	I've used GitHub as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website in a live environment.

### Responsiveness

Expected: to be displayed and re-sized across different screen sizes and width
Testing: re-layout the smaller screen and landscape screen for more visual readability and to make the most of the available space
Results: multiple testing and layout plans to achieve the look, smaller screens have text and buttons stacked so they take up the full width 
 
### <a name="responsivedesigntesting">Responsive Design Testing</a>

I used Google Chrome's Development tools to constantly test each change that I made to my website and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. I also tested my website on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop) to ensure it appeared in the desired way on different devices.

I used my own phone to test the orientation and how the site differs from portrait to landscape and to get a feel on the user experience.

## <a name="bugsfixes">Bugs</a>

**Font Awesome**
- Issue: Was not displaying the icons, was showing a square box display rather than the icon itself, these were also not re-directing to the desired linked site
- Testing:  
  1. Tested various CDN links to see if this displayed the icons - did not work
  2. Downloaded the Font Awesome css library to see if this displayed the icons - still was not showing the icons
  3. Tested removing of links, removing my own style sheet displayed the images; from this:
    - Removed different elements from the styling to see if the icons were displaying,
    - Removed the ::before and ::after elements and this showed the icons correctly

- Results: Displaying and correctly re-directing the user to the appropirate site

- Personal Note: I will research more into the ::before and ::after psuedo elements and see why this could be affecting the font awesome icons

## <a name="deploymentsite">Deployment</a>

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

-	Loaded the terminal window in my visual studio code workspace
-	Initialised Git using the Source Control in the control panel
-	Files that have been amended are automatically listed in the ‘Source Control’ panel
-	Add message in the ‘Message’ section, making sure the commits are clear and concise (re-checked previous commits for layout and what was fixed / still pending)
-	Click the ‘tick’ icon which stored the files in visual studio code
-	Click the ‘ellipsis’ icon and select the ‘push’ option
-	This then push all files and commits to the main branch
-	This will add the updated files into the ‘main branch’ option under the ‘GitHub pages’ section
-	Ran several commits after testing was carried out throughout my project.
